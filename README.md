Our Social Data Science Club is joining the [**30-Day Map Challenge**](https://30daymapchallenge.com) this November! Each day, we’ll tackle a new theme, from points and lines to creative takes like vintage style and memory maps. It’s a fun way to experiment with social data and showcase unique maps.

Check back here on our Medium page daily—we’ll be sharing all our maps and insights throughout the month! Follow along with #30DayMapChallenge for updates.
