![30 Day Map Challenge](images/30day_challenge-01.png)

Our Social Data Science Club is joining the [**30-Day Map Challenge**](https://30daymapchallenge.com) this November! Each day, we’ll tackle a new theme, from points and lines to creative takes like vintage style and memory maps. It’s a fun way to experiment with social data and showcase unique maps.

Check back here on our Medium page daily—we’ll be sharing all our maps and insights throughout the month! Follow along with #30DayMapChallenge for updates.

Before starting out, here is the code of conduct for this challenge:

Code of Conduct:

**No matter if you are a GIS expert or never made a map before this challenge, everyone is welcome to participate, But keep in mind a few things: - All maps you publish have to be your original work. Don’t steal content from others. - Give credit to the original data source whenever possible. - The challenge is all about creativity, openness and the joy of beautiful maps and cartography. It is not a competition, - Be mindful in how you use AI tooling. If you generate all of your maps with generative AI tools, where's the fun? This is not a prompt engineering challenge. - Don’t be an asshole. Don’t harass or steal from others.
